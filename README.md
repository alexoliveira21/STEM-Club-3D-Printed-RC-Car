# autonomour-rc-car

## Goal

This was a summer project completed by the West Valley College STEM Club. Our goal was to create a 3D printed RC car which we would then train to be autonomous using Tensorflow. The design of the car was aquired from thingiverse which is linked [here](https://bit.ly/2lIrMFG). We wanted to have an autonomous vehicle travel arround the West Valley campus performing certain tasks. Below is a detailed process of how we achieved this goal. We have included all the materials needed, and detailed all the necessary steps to build the car, all the required libraries and code to make sure the car will run.

## How did we do it?
